    "If you've never worked with imaging data before you might at this point be thinking something along the lines of \"hey, don't people move in the scanner though?\" or \"surely, we're going to have to do something else to make these images line up?\". Normally, you would address such questions when you preprocess your data. But for our purposes today, this has already been done for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, preprocessing is an important part of any imaging study and it is important to know what has happened to the data before analysis, so that you can understand what the analysis is taking care of. Here we'll just briefly list a few common preprocessing steps which may have been applied to the data before analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distortion Correction:** Functional MRI images are generated using a magnetic field induced by a superconducting coil. In theory, the magnetic field should be perfectly homogeneous and uniform across space. However, in practice, inhomogeneities in the magnetic field are common, often caused by differences in the magnetic susceptibility properties of the tissue types being scanned. Fortunately, magnetic field inhomogeneties behave in a predictable manner and are often fixed in a preprocessing stage by \"warping\" an image.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Motion Correction:** Image acquisition can be a lengthy process and it is difficult for participants to remain completely still for such prolonged periods of time. As a result, it is inevitable that there will be some movement of the head during any image acquisition. In this stage of the pre-processing pipeline, images are transformed to line up with one another (often the middle image of the time series is used as a reference).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Co-registration:** In order to compare them to something meaningful, we usually want our images to \"line-up\" or be \"aligned\" to the subject's anatomy. For this reason, the images are often \"co-registered\" to the subject's anatomical image (e.g. `sM00223_002.img`) during pre-processing. This means that all of the images have now been transformed to have the same shape and size as the subject's anatomical image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Registration:** Often, we are also interested in comparing the results of analysis \"between-subjects\". For this reason, images are often aligned to some \"standard template\" to allow between subject comparison. We will revisit this idea in the next notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brain Extraction:** Non-brain structure, such as the skull and surrounding tissues, are typically removed from all of the images before analysis. This process is performed using the anatomical image as a reference and is also sometimes known as skull-stripping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spatial Smoothing:** Spatial data is noisy. One thing we can do to combat this is convolve the data with a Gaussian kernel along each of the three dimensions (i.e. make it *smoother*). This is often done during pre-processing but it is also common to perform smoothing during the first-level analysis. We will investigate this further in the first-level example in this notebook."

Often we set a cutoff period as the longest period between two trials of the same condition multiplied by 2. For instance, in our case the longest period is 42s, so the `high_pass` frequency shall be 1/84 Hz ~ 0.012 Hz. This has the effect of removing periodic behaviour which is too long to be caused by our experiment.
